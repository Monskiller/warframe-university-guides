Welcome to Warframe University, Tenno <@{userid}>.

The ranks available at this moment are `%roleme Novice` and `%roleme Apprentice`. Assign the role that matches your in-game (not steam) hours.

0-100 hours: Novice 
101-200 Hours: Apprentice 

If you have 200+ hours, post a screenshot of your ingame play time (example <http://i.imgur.com/4hVm6gG.jpg>) and you will be assigned to the appropriate role.

Once you have been assigned Novice, Apprentice, Journeymen, or the higher role, you will have access to the other general chats, such as general, recess, and robotics.

We have classes you can join! Enter robotics after getting your role and type in `%roleme list` to get a list of available classes.
For example if i would like to discuss modding, type in `%roleme modding`

If you have any trouble please feel free to PM any of the @Synthesis Hunter(Mod) or @Principals for assistance

Please allow up to 12 hours for registration. Some of us are still asleep (silly timezones).
