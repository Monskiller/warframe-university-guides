Welcome to Warframe University, Tenno.
Please read #read_first Before posting

The ranks available at this moment are `%roleme Novice` and `%roleme Apprentice` please assign your rank according to your ingame profile playtime, not steam hours

0-100 hours = Novice 
101-200 Hours = Apprentice 

If you have 200+ hours, contact a mod to be assigned to the Journeyman role. 

We have multiple 'classes' you can join, just go to robotics after assigning your role and type in `%roleme list` to get a list of classes you can join.
For example if i would like to discuss modding, type in `%roleme modding`

If you have any trouble please feel free to PM any of the @Synthesis Hunter(mod) or @Principals for assistance
